        <p><strong><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aladdin_(1992_Disney_film)">Aladdin</a></strong> is a 1992 animated disney movie that folows young and poor Aladdin in the city of Agrabha(?). Alladin lives his life, casually as a street rat, stealing to make a living. Alongside him is Apu, his trusted monkey and sidekick. One day, a strange man, comes up to Alladin and offers him a job. He wants Alladin to go inside a cave and search and retrieve a lamp, while everything else can be his. That was a trap, and as soon as Alladin hands him the lamp, we learn that the unknown man is Jafar, the bad consultant and mage to the Sultan. Jafar throws Alladin back in the cave, but before he is tossed there, Alladin takes the lamp. The story begins when Alladin learns that the lamp is magical and has a genie that will grant him 3 wishes.</p>
