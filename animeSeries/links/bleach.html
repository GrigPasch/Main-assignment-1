    <p>Bleach is propablly the first anime I've ever seen. It was written by Tite Kubo and it follows the story of Kurosaki Ichigo, a young Japanese boy, that one day starts to see things he shouldn't. He meets a shinigami (death god) Rukia and his journey begins from this point on. He helps here preserve order and balance between the living world and the world of the dead. Alongside there are many ups and downs, but plot twist always helps the protagonist, so he makes it through everything.</p>
